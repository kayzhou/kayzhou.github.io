## How to Configure Pages

Be default, I have included links to the following pages in the header bar, which are specified in the `_config.yml` file (the `nav` list).

- Posts
- Publications
- About
- Categories
- Tags
- Home

However, they don't work out of the box. You need to call `hexo new page <page_path>` to create a page for them (e.g., execute `hexo new page categories` to create the categories page). If you don't want any of them, remove the entries from the config.

> I think you can just create the files manually (e.g., `source/categories/index.md`) instead of using `hexo new page`, but I'm not sure.

> After changing the config and set of pages, make sure the run `hexo clean` and `hexo g` to re-generate the site (because Hexo will cache something that causes the changes to not take effect).

### Categories and Tags Page

For the categories and tags pages, you also have to respectively set `layout: categories` and `layout: tags` for them to work.

The categories and tags are automatically generated by Hexo. Just add `categories` and `tags` (both are a string or a list of strings) in the frontmatter of your posts. For instance:

```yml
---
author:
title:
categories: Paper
tags:
- paper
- arxiv
```

### About and Publications Page

Run `hexo new page about` and `hexo new page publications` to create the about and publications page, respectively. You can also use custom paths for these pages, but you need to modify the `nav` list in the `_config.yml` file accordingly. Then just write the content of these two pages in Markdown in `_posts/about/index.md` and `_posts/publications/index.md`, respectively.

### Home Page

The options to specify in the `_config.yml` file include:

- `portrait`: The path to the image in the center of the home page.
- `description`, `title`, `subtitle`: These three default config entries will be shown in the home page below the portrait image.
- `my_location` and `cv_path`: These will be shown between the subtitle and description.

### Featured Posts

By default, this theme will show a list of featured posts in the home page below the description of the author. Featured posts are identified as posts with a `featured: true` entry in the frontmatter. To disable this, set `show_featured_posts: false` in the config file.

## Footer Configuration

Currently, the footer can only be modified by directly modifying the `fengye/layout/_partial/footer.ejs` source file, but I guess there is not much to change here.

## Acknowledgments

A large part of the code and README is mostly based on the [Maple theme](https://www.github.com/xbmlz/hexo-theme-maple) by [xbmlz](https://www.github.com/xbmlz).
